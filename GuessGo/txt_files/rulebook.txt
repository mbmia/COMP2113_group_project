GuessGo is a game of probabilities. You will be playing this game against none other than me, the computer. First, depending on a number that you choose, we will both get a virtual grid. You can think of it as an invisible checkboard. Then we will receive a list of random words. From this list, we will have to choose words to put on the empty cells of our grids. Now starts the fun part. You and I will take turns to call out words from the list. If the word appears on the other player's grid, they will have to cross it out. In this way, the game goes on till one of us is able to guess all the words in a row or column in the other one's grid. Then, that player becomes the winner. Simple, right? I, the computer, will be choosing words from the pool at random, so I will not have an advantage over you for knowing the words you put on your grid.  :)
